## Project: Global Minimum Variance Portflio for Shares/Stocks

**Objective**: 
>Optimise a portfolio of selected stocks to minimise risk

Functionality: 
1. User selects N stocks they may be interested in making a portfolio of. User inputs the Yahoo Finance Tickrs of selected stocks (for ex. APPL,MSFT, etc). 
2. Running the script will result in vector 'weights' which defines the optimal investment as a % of total in each stock of the portfolio.
3. The weights are optimally theoretically minimizing the variance or risk of the portfolio of entered stocks;
